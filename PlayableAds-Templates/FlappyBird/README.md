# Flappy Bird
A classic Flappy Bird game recreated using Phaser 3.
Players control a bird sprite, navigating it through a series of moving mountains by tapping the screen to make the bird flap its wings. The bird is affected by gravity, causing it to descend unless the player intervenes with timely flaps. The game features collision detection, where the bird will crash if it hits the mountains or the bomb, ending the game. A score system tracks how many mountians the player successfully passes, with the goal of achieving the highest score possible. As the game progresses, the mountains and bombs move faster, increasing the difficulty.
