# Block Shot
Block Shot is a casual shooting and arcade game developed with PhaserJS. Players control a character by dragging left and right to dodge and shoot falling blocks. The goal is to destroy as many blocks as possible and avoid being crushed.
Special blocks such as "2X" and "SpeedUp" will occasionally appear. Destroying these blocks grants powerful buffs like double bullets or increased shooting speed, helping you clear obstacles more efficiently.
When in danger, you can activate the Fire Mode by clicking the button at the bottom right or pressing the SPACE key. During Fire Mode, your bullet count and fire rate are greatly increased for a short time, allowing you to break through tough situations.
Challenge your reflexes and strategy, aim for the highest score, and see how long you can survive!
